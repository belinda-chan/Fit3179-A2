            <p>The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey that ranks the happiness levels of 156 countries based on how happy 
                their citizens perceive themselves to be. 
            <br><br> In the 2020 edition, the World Happiness Report looks at six key variables to evaluate the levels of happiness 
            around the world, which are: <b>GDP per capita</b>, <b>social support</b>, <b>healthy life expectancy</b>, <b>freedom to make life choices</b>, 
            <b>generosity</b>, and <b>freedom from corruption</b> (World Happiness Report). 
            <br><br> This visualisation aims to explore these variables, some of them from different perspectives, to see how they compare for the happiest nations.
